# Mini Project One
## Project Description 

<pre>
Task:

Implement a Restful service allowing an admin to trigger a batch job.

The batch job , reads a CSV file and writes its contents into Mysql DB after performing some conversion.

 

CSV file format:

First , last , GPA , AGE

String, String,Double, INT>0

 

Database table format:

First , last , GPA , DOB

String, String,Double, Date ( first day of the year)

 

Deliverable:

- You service should implement security, only admin can access it

- Your batch will be executed once , feel free to remove DB contents every time your app starts

- Docker your solution along with README.md file to explain how to run it

 

 

Hints:

Get familiar with:

- Spring MVC/Restful , ORM , Spring security ( optionally with JWT tokens)

- Spring Batch

- Docker and usage of docker-compose. Donâ€™t create DB image , use docker hub

- Upload only source code files , put your CSV  file inside your  app image
